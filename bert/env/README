Instructions for installing the environment and conda:

1. Create interactive job: 'si --time=02:00:00 -c 7'

2. Use 'source install_conda.sh' to install miniconda in your HOME directory

3. Use './create_environment.sh' to create the environment

IMPORTANT: If you want to use conda in your own projects on the hpc you need to execute
'export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"' first. The scripts 'brats_train_hpc.sh'
and 'brats_deploy_hpc.sh' already include this line, therefore you can run them without
any modifications.
